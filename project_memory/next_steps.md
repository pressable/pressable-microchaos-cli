# Next Steps

## All Major Issues Resolved! ðŸŽ‰

## Completed
- âœ… Fixed PHP 8.1+ deprecation warning (float to int conversion)
- âœ… Fixed `--cache-headers` breaking `--burst` (variable name collision)
- âœ… Enhanced cache header analysis with per-request display
- âœ… Improved cache summary with accurate percentages
- âœ… Documented Pressable platform limitations in README
- âœ… Corrected understanding of burst flag usage patterns
- âœ… Documented `--cache-headers` as Pressable-specific feature

## Platform Limitations (Not Bugs)  
- `--progressive` mode: Limited by Pressable's ~10 request rate limit on loopback
- `--concurrency-mode=async`: Cannot bypass platform rate limits  
- These are documented in README as platform limitations, not bugs
- **Burst flag works as intended**: Controls serial requests before pause (not concurrent)

## Current State
- **No known bugs remaining**
- Tool is fully functional for Pressable environments
- Cache analysis provides detailed, accurate Pressable-specific insights
- Documentation is comprehensive and accurate

## Future Enhancements (If Needed)
- Enhanced error handling and reporting
- Better flag validation to prevent conflicts
- Platform detection to warn users about limitations
